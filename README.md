# R for beginners

Presented at GDS Unconference 2019.

Intended as a session for inquisitive beginners to learn a bit about what R does.

Files in this fast-and-loose repo as follows:

* `r-for-beginners.Rproj` is an R Project file
* `r-for-beginners.R` is an R script containing the live demo part of the session
* `20190409-pokemon-bmi-official-stat` is very much a fake and incredibly simple example of creating a reproducible output with R Markdown
* `data/` contains two datasets: `pogo.csv` (data about Pokemon collected from the Pokemon Go app) and `pokedex.csv` (some extra information about types)

The Pokemon Company and Niantic own Pokemon/Pokemon Go.
